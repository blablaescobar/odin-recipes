        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
            <li>Optional: Wasabi peas for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, 
                and granulated sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat, 
                stirring occasionally, until it reaches a simmer. Remove 
                from heat.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth and 
                pale in color.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the bowl with the 
                egg yolks, whisking continuously to temper the eggs.</li>
            <li>Once combined, return the mixture to the saucepan and 
                place it back on the stove over low heat. Cook the 
                mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly 
                and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes. Do not 
                let it boil.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the wasabi 
                paste until thoroughly incorporated. Adjust the amount of 
                wasabi paste to your desired level of spiciness.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean 
                bowl to remove any lumps or solids.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, ensuring the wrap touches 
                the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. 
                Refrigerate the custard for at least 4 hours or overnight 
                until thoroughly chilled.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, transfer the custard to an ice cream maker 
                and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions 
                until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
            <li>If desired, fold in some crushed wasabi peas for an extra 
                burst of flavor and texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to a freezer-safe container 
                and freeze for an additional 2-4 hours, or until firm.</li>
            <li>Serve the wasabi ice cream scoops in bowls or cones, 
                garnishing with additional wasabi peas if desired.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the unique and refreshing flavor of homemade wasabi 
                ice cream!</li>
        </ol>

            <i>Note: Wasabi ice cream is best enjoyed fresh but can be 
                stored in the freezer for up to 1 week. Allow it to soften 
                slightly at room temperature for a few minutes before serving.
