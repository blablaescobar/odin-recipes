        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small seedless watermelon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices prosciutto, torn into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup arugula</li>
            <li>Balsamic glaze, for drizzling (optional)</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the watermelon into rounds, about 1/2 inch thick. 
                Use a cookie cutter or knife to cut the rounds into 
                smaller, individual pizza-sized rounds.
            </li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the white vinegar, granulated 
                sugar, salt, whole black peppercorns, and red pepper flakes. 
                Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 
                until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from heat and 
                let the pickling liquid cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Place the watermelon rounds in a shallow dish or container 
                and pour the pickling liquid over them, ensuring they are 
                fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour 
                to allow the watermelon to pickle.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the pickled 
                watermelon rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment 
                paper.
            </li>
            <li>Bake the pickled watermelon rounds in the preheated oven 
                for 5-7 minutes, just until slightly softened.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the watermelon rounds from the oven and let them 
                cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>To assemble the pizza, top each pickled watermelon round 
                with crumbled feta cheese, torn pieces of prosciutto, and 
                a handful of arugula.
            </li>
            <li>Drizzle the pizzas with balsamic glaze and olive oil, 
                and season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy this unconventional and 
                refreshing twist on pizza!
            </li>
            <li>Optionally, you can experiment with additional toppings 
                such as thinly sliced red onion, fresh basil leaves, or 
                a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes for added flavor 
                and complexity.
            </li>
            <li>Serve your pickled watermelon pizzas as appetizers, snacks, 
                or even as a unique main dish at your next gathering. Enjoy 
                the surprising blend of flavors and textures!
