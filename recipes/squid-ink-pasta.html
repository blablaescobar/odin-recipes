        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz squid ink spaghetti or linguine</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 oz white chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the squid ink pasta according to the package 
                instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, 
                reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water.
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt the unsalted butter over 
                medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until 
                fragrant, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a simmer. 
                Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until 
                slightly thickened.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the grated 
                Parmesan cheese, stirring constantly until melted and 
                smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chopped white chocolate to the sauce, stirring 
                until it melts completely and the sauce is creamy and 
                well combined.
            </li>
            <li>If the sauce is too thick, gradually stir in some of the 
                reserved pasta water until you reach your desired 
                consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste, adjusting 
                as needed.
            </li>
            <li>Add the cooked squid ink pasta to the skillet with the 
                white chocolate sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta 
                evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the pasta to 
                absorb some of the sauce and heat through.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the squid 
                ink pasta with white chocolate sauce to serving plates.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley for a pop of color and 
                flavor.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy this unique and indulgent twist 
                on pasta with an unexpected sweet-savory combination. Buon 
                Appetito!
            </li>
