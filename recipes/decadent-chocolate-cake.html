        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Indulge in our Chocolate Avocado Cake, where creamy avocado replaces butter for a healthier twist. 
            Enhanced with a hint of cayenne pepper for a subtle kick, this moist, decadent delight is topped

            cake experience.<p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Free Trade chocolate</li>
            <li>5 avocados</li>
            <li>1kg cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 cans of beetroot frosting</li>
            <li>1 hamster tongue</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a cake pan with butter or non-stick spray.</li>
            <li>Melt the Free Trade chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water or in the microwave, stirring until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, mash the avocados until creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the melted chocolate to the mashed avocados, stirring until well combined.</li>
            <li>Sift the cayenne pepper into the chocolate-avocado mixture, stirring until evenly distributed. Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper to your taste preference.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Once the cake has cooled, spread the beetroot frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake.</li>
            <li>For a quirky garnish, if desired, place the hamster tongue on top of the cake as a playful decoration.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the chocolate avocado cake, enjoying the unique blend of flavors and textures!</li>
            <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>Enjoy making out with your chocolate hamster!</li>
